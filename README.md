# React Neural Network

This is visualising a very simple example of a neural network and the states (weights) through which it iterates in a training process

## Commands

The following have been exposed on the window.

*   `startTraining()` will start a simple training procedure where random points are generated and the decision of the network is corrected if wrong.
*   `brain.train()` will do a single training iteration on the amount of points provided : `brain.train(100)` will train the network on a 100 points of data.
